###Setup

Setup libraries
```{R Load Libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2) #technically included in tidyverse
library(sf)
```


Load Data
```{R Load Data}
#name files
p.counties <- "./data/County_Boundaries.shp"
p.stations <- "./data/Non-Tidal_Water_Quality_Monitoring_Stations_in_the_Chesapeake_Bay.shp"

#Read files in sf package
d.counties <- sf::read_sf(p.counties)
d.stations <- sf::read_sf(p.stations)

# check for validity
d.stations %>% sf::st_is_valid()
d.counties %>% sf::st_is_valid() # returns false for one feature, so we need to fix

# fix it "in place"
d.counties <- d.counties %>% sf::st_make_valid()

```

### Task 1: Basic data manipulation

1.1 For each county, calculate its land area as percentage of the total area (land + water) for that state.

```{r}

d.counties %>% 
  mutate(., TotArea = ALAND10 + AWATER10)
#%>% 
  #summarize(., PcntLand = (ALAND10 / TotArea)*100)


```


1.2 For each state, find the county that has the largest proportion of its land as water (water area / total area)

```{r}

```

1.3 Count the number of counties in each state

```{r}

```

1.4 Which station has the shortest name (STATION_NA) in the study area?

```{r}

```

### Task 2: Plotting attribute data
...for each plot, label your axes properly and give your plot a title

2.1 Make a scatterplot showing the relationship between land area and water area for each county. Color each point using the state variable

```{r}

```

2.2 Make a histogram of drainage area (Drainage_A) for all monitoring stations

```{r}

```

2.3 Make a similar histogram of drainage area (Drainage_A) for all monitoring stations. This time, shade/color each portion of the histogram's bar(s) using the state variable

```{r}

```

### Task 3: Write a function
3.1 Write a function that does the following:

A. accepts a vector of arbitrary numbers, calculates the mean, median, maximum, and minimum of the vector

B. Sorts the vector

C. returns a list of those values from A and the sorted vector from B

D. the function should only work with numeric values and print an error message if any other data type are found

Test it with the following vectors

`c(1, 0, -1), c(10, 100, 1000), c(.1, .001, 1e8), c("a", "b", "c")`

```{r}

```

### Task 4: (slightly) more complex spatial analysis. 
...Note, you may need to find supplementary data to help you with these tasks

4.1 Calculate the number of monitoring stations in each state

```{r}

```

4.2 Calculate the average size of counties in New York (that are also in this study area)

```{r}

```

4.3 Calculate which state has monitoring stations with the greatest average drainage area (Drainage_A)

```{r}

```

## Questions

1. In using the intersection functions, are the following two statements equivalent? If not, explain how. Be sure to think about BOTH the spatial data structures AND the attribute data. Would your answer be different if we were using different types of data?

```
 sf::st_intersection(d.stations, del.counties)
 sf::st_intersection(del.counties, d.stations)
```
